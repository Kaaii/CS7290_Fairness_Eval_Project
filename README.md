## Description
Using the law school success example from the paper, we replicate our version of the simulated example to show the difference in a fair prediction of law school success vs. an unfair one using Pyro. 

## Deliverables 

We will demonstrate fairness evaluation on a full (using all attributes including protected in prediction), unaware (using only non-protected observed attributes), and a fair model (inferring the unobserved variable K to predict).
