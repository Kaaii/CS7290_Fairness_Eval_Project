# Fairness Evaluation on Sprite Data
Project repo for CS7290 

Based on the paper: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/eb/r30.pdf

Sprite data source: TODO

## Description
"Fairness evaluation using the causal explanation formula.  Demonstrate the concepts of this paper on this sprites data.  Use simulated examples."
From the paper's conclusion: 
"We introduced a new family of counterfactual measures capable of distinctly capturing the most prominent causal mechanisms that can bring about discrimination in the real-world (i.e., direct, indirect, spurious). We derived the Causal Explanation Formula (for short, Explanation Formula), which allows one to understand how an observed disparity between the protected attribute and the outcome variable can be decomposed in terms of the causal mechanisms underlying the specific (and unknown) decision-making process. We provided identifiability conditions for the Explanation Formula, which delineate when (and how) the corresponding counterfactual distributions can be estimated from real data. Finally, we applied the Explanation Formula to the problem of policy evaluation, providing the first quantitative explanation of the trade-off between outcome and procedural fairness."

TODO: What is the protected attribute we want to simulate? And the outcome variable? What is our dataset going to look like?

## Deliverables 

We will use the Causal Explanation Formula as described in the paper to observe and understand disparity in a simulated example using the sprite data. We will define a protected attribute and an outcome variable, and using the formula, determine the causal mechanisms underlying the decision-making process and see if that protected attribute has a direct, indirect, or spurious causal mechanism on the outcome. 

TODO: make this more specific depending on what we define above
